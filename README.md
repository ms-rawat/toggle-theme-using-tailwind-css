### 🌓 Themed React App with Tailwind CSS v4📝
## Description
 showcases a modern and efficient implementation of a day/night (light/dark) mode feature in a React application. It leverages the latest Tailwind CSS v4 with its CSS-first configuration and React's Context API for seamless state management. The key innovation is the use of semantic color names (e.g., bg-background-primary) that automatically adapt to the chosen theme, eliminating the need for repetitive dark: prefixes in your JSX. User preferences are persisted using localStorage and the initial theme respects system preferences.✨ FeaturesAutomatic Theme Adaptation: Semantic color utility classes (e.g., bg-background-primary, text-text-primary) automatically switch between light and dark values.Manual Theme Toggle: A user-friendly button to switch between day and night modes.System Preference Detection: Automatically applies the user's preferred theme based on their operating system settings on initial load.Theme Persistence: Remembers the last selected theme using localStorage across sessions.Clean Codebase: Utilizes Tailwind CSS v4's CSS-first configuration and React Context for a highly maintainable and scalable solution.Smooth Transitions: CSS transitions ensure a pleasant visual experience when switching themes.⚙️ Installation InstructionsTo get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
